Learning from Coursera
- The final project is to build a map using UnfoldingMaps
- On this map, there are markers to show the countries that had earthquake
- For each earthquake, we determine the magnitude and assign a color and size for our marker
- More Features to be announced ...

Week 2
lifeExpectancy : 
Using GoogleMapPorvider to  show a map to the applet. In the map, we have different colors for different countries
We retrieve countries' code and percentange of life expectancy from a csv file and store these 2 data in a Map: "HashMap"
then from a .json file, we were able to retrieve a list of Feature "List<Feature>" for more details about Features or UnfoldingMaps check this link: http://unfoldingmaps.org/javadoc/
We also use a list of Marker. From the value of life expectancy, we assign a color to each country in the map.

EarthquakeCityMap:
An application with an interactive map displaying earthquake data.


Week 3
Using Inheritance and polymorphism to create different type of markers depending on where the earthquake occurs: On land or in the ocean

Organize a complex application by using several different classes.
Build a class hierarchy to reflect the different kinds of markers for different categories of earthquakes.
Write code to override methods in base classes.
Write an abstract class that implements some methods and leaves others abstract.
Use PGraphics methods to draw shapes.
