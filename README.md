Learning from Coursera
- The final project is to build a map using UnfoldingMaps
- On this map, there are markers to show the countries that had earthquake
- For each earthquake, we determine the magnitude and assign a color and size for our marker
- More Features to be announced ...

Week 2
lifeExpectancy : 
Using GoogleMapPorvider to  show a map to the applet. In the map, we have different colors for different countries
We retrieve countries' code and percentange of life expectancy from a csv file and store these 2 data in a Map: "HashMap"
then from a .json file, we were able to retrieve a list of Feature "List<Feature>" for more details about Features or UnfoldingMaps check this link: http://unfoldingmaps.org/javadoc/
We also use a list of Marker. From the value of life expectancy, we assign a color to each country in the map.
